Loan Prediction Using selected Machine Learning Algorithms

In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations, etc. The recipient (i.e. the borrower) incurs a debt, and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid, and also to repay the principal amount borrowed. To read more check out Wikipedia. The whole process of ascertaining if a burrower would pay back loans might be tedious hence the need to automate the procedure.

In this blog post, I’d be walking us through Loan prediction using some selected Machine Learning Algorithms.

Source of Dataset: The dataset for this project is retrieved from kaggle, the home of Data Science.

The problem at hand: The major aim of this project is to predict which of the customers will have their loan paid or not. Therefore, this is a supervised classification problem to be trained with algorithms like:

  Logistic Regression
  Decision Tree
  Random Forest
Note: The machine learning classifier that can be used is not limited to the aforementioned. Other models like XGBoost, CatBoost and the likes can be applied in the training of the model. The choice of these three algorithms is sequel upon the desire to keep the model explanatory of itself and also, the dataset is small.

Disclaimer:

In this project, default hyperparameter values are employed.
More visualization can be done beyond what’s executed in this post
The training dataset provided is the focus because we are not making a submission to kaggle for scoring. Hence, we split the train into a validation set to get our evaluations estimated.
